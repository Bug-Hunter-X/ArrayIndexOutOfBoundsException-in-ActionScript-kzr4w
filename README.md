This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript error that can occur when trying to access the last element of an array. The error arises because ActionScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the last valid index is always one less than the length of the array. Attempting to access the element at index myArray.length throws an error. The solution demonstrates how to properly access the last element using myArray[myArray.length - 1].
